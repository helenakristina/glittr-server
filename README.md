## Background
As part of a project for [Women Hack the Crisis](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/women-hack-the-crisis-a-global-virtual-all-women-hackathon-tickets-101464226232), we are building a web application for children to promote well-being in this uncertain time. Initially, it will focus on bringing a local arts/creativity/wellness-based non-profit into the digital world [Enspire Arts](http://enspirearts.org/), allowing students in underserved communities accessibility to arts and creative expression through visual and digital art, music, movement, and creative writing. 

Our goals are not only to create technical solutions to stand-in for physical classroom, but also to leverage the benefits of technical solutioning to support the mission.  Eventually, we would like to extend our platform to help serve other areas of wellness for children, including meditation, yoga, movement, emotional support, etc. 
**Wellness is going to be a critical tool for helping the next generation recover from the crisis.**
